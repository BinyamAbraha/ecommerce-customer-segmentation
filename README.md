- Use **RFM Analysis** to segment customers into meaningful groups.  
- Provide actionable **business recommendations** based on insights.  

## 🔍 Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values, duplicates, and segregated refund transactions.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized revenue trends, product performance, and customer distributions.
